/*
Bronze:
Build an Automobile class that takes in a make and a model in the constructor. Bind those two parameters to the class's properties with matching names. 
​
Silver:
Add two methods to the Automobile class: start() and stop(). Each method should print out a message to the console that the engine has started or stopped. Include the vehicle's make and model in the output.
​
Gold:
Use the new keyword to create a new instance of the Automobile class and assign the new instance to a variable. Run both methods.
